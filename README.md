# Cplusplus-program
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
\\Learning about the many variables you had to take into account such as interest, month, year, was probably the first difficult attempt for this project, since you might miss or \\forget one variable, which I did.
What did you do particularly well?
\\The outputs, such as the menu has so far been the only easy part to do, so I have enjoyed doing the front end visual stuff.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
\\A bunch of googling and stockoverflow with questions and errors, I also have a couple programmer friends I will ask for tips. Making it work and focusing on coding standards has \\made it so I believe it is efficient, and my friends will point out "secure" standards for me.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
\\The FOR loops and dividing it by the year, was a mind break for me, which I had to go back to previous homework points to hyper focus on how to properly get it to work together. \\My support network is and has always been focusing on references, or similar code that I can tweak or make my own.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
\\I hope the work knowledge will be transferrable, and assumedly if I ever get stuck, I can always refer back if I get stuck. Whereas the skills, previously not knowing this \\language and learning it and working with it has created uses, and actual implementation of the code for me.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I left comments explaining what is happening and what the code is doing, it is adaptable since it is still a basic program, and maintainable since the for loops make it so the program understands what to do.
